This is the repository for the first workshop of the 2021-2022 Academic year, titled "An Encounter with Pythons and Pandas". The session 
included a quick review of common Python workflows and the Pandas package.  It was intended as more of a review, but was still suitable for 
beginners as it covered main introductory data science concepts. The session assumed some Python and data science familiarity. The link to the
Google Colab Notebook is [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ExbyYZPDQhFTatw2dhKYa7cPP8WtMS7Q?usp=sharing).
